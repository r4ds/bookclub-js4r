# A Realistic Widget

**Learning objectives:**

- THESE ARE NICE TO HAVE BUT NOT ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY

## SLIDE 1

- ADD SLIDES AS SECTIONS (`##`).
- TRY TO KEEP THEM RELATIVELY SLIDE-LIKE; THESE ARE NOTES, NOT THE BOOK ITSELF.

## Meeting Videos

00:11:57	russ:	Apologies for my pronunciation
00:20:13	russ:	https://www.npmjs.com/package/peity?activeTab=dependencies
00:25:18	Arthur Shaw:	Following on what Russ said, the peity library on npm shows no dependencies, but the use basic usage example uses jQuery. At the risk of being lawyerly, perhaps the library doesn't depend on jQuery, but using it may require (or most easily be done via) jQuery. npm link: https://www.npmjs.com/package/peity
