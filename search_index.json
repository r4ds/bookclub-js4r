This is the best way to learn the material. Presentations will usually consist of a review of the material, a discussion, and/or a demonstration of the principles presented in that chapter.

If one wants to integrate R and JS code, packages provide a way to share both JS code (or library) and R code for making JS available through R. JSON. If want to share/pass data between R and JS, JSON is the lingua franca. JavaScript. If one wants to work with JS (in the browser), it is good to know some basics: How to see where JS works How variables work How JS interacts with the DOM Shiny. If one wants to use JS in Shiny, one needs to know a few main mechanisms for bringing JS into Shiny apps. "],["r-package-development.html", "2.2 R package development", " 2.2 R package development 2.2.1 How to create packages Create: From the RStudio GUI, File &gt; New Project &gt; New Directory &gt; R Package From the console, usethis::create_package(\"mypackage\") Develop: The very short version: Create content Add scripts/functions usethis::use_r(\"MyScript\") Document Add R dependencies (usethis::use_package(\"SomePackage\")) Write tests usethis::use_test(\"MyScript\") # makes ./tests/testthat/test-MyScript.R Test content interactively, load package and tinker (devtools::load_all()) formally, run tests (devtools::check()) Fix issues Rinse and repeat The longer and more helpful version can be found in “The Whole Game” chapter of R Packages. 2.2.2 What constitutes a package 2.2.2.1 Metadata Two main files: DESCRIPTION and NAMESPACE. DESCRIPTION, among other things, provides a list what needs to be installed in order for the package to work (i.e., “imports”). NAMESPACE dictates which functions, of those defined in the package, are made available for use (i.e., “exports”). 2.2.2.2 R code What: functions defined by the package How: write one or more .R script, where each script defines one or more function. Where: in R/ 2.2.2.3 Documentation What: documentation for functions What the function does What the parameters are Details, examples, etc. Where: just above each function definition in the .R scripts in R/. How: When writing functions, use special comments #' and tags (e.g., #' @param) provided by the {roxygen} package When building the package, devtools::document() creates separate documentation files for end users and stores them in man/. 2.2.2.4 Installed files What: In general, files that are downloaded as-is into the top level package directory when the package is installed. For our purposes, JS scripts or libraries. Where: When developing, located in inst/ After installing, located in the root of the package directory. How: Copy files in inst/ Write code to link R and JS. Add the programming language to the SystemRequirements field of DESCRIPTION. See (slightly) more here Examples found in the wild: {echarts4r} wraps echarts.js {reactable} wraps React Table {dataui} wraps data-ui "],["json.html", "2.3 JSON", " 2.3 JSON 2.3.1 Serializing “Serializing” means converting data to JSON format JSON format is the equivalent of a list in R. See example here {jsonlite} provides a Rosetta stone for translating data bi-directionally between R and JSON: From R to JSON jsonlite::toJSON() From JSON to R jsonlite::fromJSON() 2.3.2 Tablular data How JSON represents a data frame In R, a data frame is a list of columns In JSON, which has no such concept, a data frame is “translated” as a list of rows, where each row is itself a JSON object. See this nice graphical example. How R handles rectangular data from JSON See code examples below table example. "],["javascript.html", "2.4 JavaScript", " 2.4 JavaScript 2.4.1 Developer tools Pop the hood by inspecting page In browser, see here for Chrome, for example. In RStudio IDE, which is built on Chromium, can use similar tools. Views of interest Elements. Shows the DOM, which could help inspect HTML produced by R (e.g., Shiny app). Console. Much like the R console, shows messages, warnings, and errors, which could be helpful in understanding and debugging issues. 2.4.2 How JS variables differ from R Declaration Can declare variable without assigning a value Can declare variables in three ways: var. Define a variable of global scope. let. Define a variable of restricted scope. const. Define a variable whose value cannot be changed. Scope What is scope. In effect, the accessibility of an object. Which scopes in JS; how compare to R. Global. Like objects in R’s global environment. Function. Like variables inside an R function. Block. No direct R equivalent. Accessible within a block between { }. See more here. 2.4.3 Document Object Model (DOM) What is the DOM Description of an HTML page as a tree of the elements and attributes that comprise the page. Elements are characterized by one or more of: ID Tag Class(es) Etc See visual explanation here. How JS interacts with the DOM Select/query by: ID Tag Class Change content and/or attributes of the element See nice summary here. "],["shiny.html", "2.5 Shiny", " 2.5 Shiny Two ways to import JS dependences in Shiny: Serving files (e.g., JS script) Using {htmltools} 2.5.1 Serving static files Types of static files Images CSS stylesheets JS scripts How to serve files to Shiny Option 1: when shiny::runApp is run, load everything in www/ directory. Option 2: specify path via shiny::addResourcePath and load those resources. How to use shiny::addResourcePath Parameters directoryPath. Where in file system to find file(s). prefix. Where in URL to make file(s) available. Placement In raw HTML, inside the &lt;head&gt;, with a &lt;script&gt; tag that points to the source file. In Shiny, in a special place in the ui. Inside same tags as in raw HTML Inside singleton so that the files are served only once. Best practices organizing static files Unspoken recommendations; not hard rules Single folder to contain the collections of files (e.g., assets/, static/) Subfolder for each type of file (e.g., CSS, JS, image, etc.) 2.5.2 htmltools What does htmltools do? Prosaically, helps create HTML tags More importantly for our purposes, helps with importing and managing external dependences How does htmltools help manage dependencies? Provides an R interface. Creates a dependency object that R resolves as an actual HTML dependency. Points to a dependence in a package directory. If a package is the source of a dependency, can construct a relative path to package library’s inst/, where dependency lives. Where to place htmltools in R scripts? In Shiny, in the UI. Similar to serving files, but simpler. In RMarkdown, in an evaluated code chuck. "],["serving-files-v.-htmltools.html", "2.6 Serving files v. htmltools", " 2.6 Serving files v. htmltools Why prefer htmltools? Available in both Shiny and RMarkdown, while serving files only works for Shiny. Allows one to assess a package’s dependencies, which helps in cases where dependencies of two packages may conflict. Why use shiny::addResourcePath? Certainly, useful for loading JS and CSS. But also useful for other file types that an app may need, such as images or JSON data.
