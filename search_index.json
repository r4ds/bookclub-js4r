DESCRIPTION, among other things, provides a list what needs to be installed in order for the package to work (i.e., “imports”). NAMESPACE dictates which functions, of those defined in the package, are made available for use (i.e., “exports”). 2.2.2.2 R code What: functions defined by the package How: write one or more .R script, where each script defines one or more function. Where: in R/ 2.2.2.3 Documentation What: documentation for functions What the function does What the parameters are Details, examples, etc. Where: just above each function definition in the .R scripts in R/. How: When writing functions, use special comments #' and tags (e.g., #' @param) provided by the {roxygen} package When building the package, devtools::document() creates separate documentation files for end users and stores them in man/. 2.2.2.4 Installed files What: In general, files that are downloaded as-is into the top level package directory when the package is installed. For our purposes, JS scripts or libraries. Where: When developing, located in inst/ After installing, located in the root of the package directory. How: Copy files in inst/ Write code to link R and JS. Add the programming language to the SystemRequirements field of DESCRIPTION.

See this nice graphical example. How R handles rectangular data from JSON See code examples below table example.

Much like the R console, shows messages, warnings, and errors, which could be helpful in understanding and debugging issues. 2.4.2 How JS variables differ from R Declaration Can declare variable without assigning a value Can declare variables in three ways: var. Define a variable of global scope. let. Define a variable of restricted scope. const. Define a variable whose value cannot be changed. Scope What is scope. In effect, the accessibility of an object. Which scopes in JS; how compare to R. Global. Like objects in R’s global environment. Function. Like variables inside an R function. Block. No direct R equivalent. Accessible within a block between { }. See more here. 2.4.3 Document Object Model (DOM) What is the DOM Description of an HTML page as a tree of the elements and attributes that comprise the page. Elements are characterized by one or more of: ID Tag Class(es) Etc See visual explanation here. How JS interacts with the DOM Select/query by: ID Tag Class Change content and/or attributes of the element See nice summary here.

Option 2: specify path via shiny::addResourcePath and load those resources. How to use shiny::addResourcePath Parameters directoryPath. Where in file system to find file(s). prefix. Where in URL to make file(s) available. Placement In raw HTML, inside the &lt;head&gt;, with a &lt;script&gt; tag that points to the source file. In Shiny, in a special place in the ui. Inside same tags as in raw HTML Inside singleton so that the files are served only once. Best practices organizing static files Unspoken recommendations; not hard rules Single folder to contain the collections of files (e.g., assets/, static/) Subfolder for each type of file (e.g., CSS, JS, image, etc.) 2.5.2 htmltools What does htmltools do? Prosaically, helps create HTML tags More importantly for our purposes, helps with importing and managing external dependences How does htmltools help manage dependencies? Provides an R interface. Creates a dependency object that R resolves as an actual HTML dependency. Points to a dependence in a package directory. If a package is the source of a dependency, can construct a relative path to package library’s inst/, where dependency lives. Where to place htmltools in R scripts? In Shiny, in the UI. Similar to serving files, but simpler. In RMarkdown, in an evaluated code chuck. "],["serving-files-v.-htmltools.html", "2.6 Serving files v. htmltools", " 2.6 Serving files v. htmltools Why prefer htmltools? Available in both Shiny and RMarkdown, while serving files only works for Shiny. Allows one to assess a package’s dependencies, which helps in cases where dependencies of two packages may conflict. Why use shiny::addResourcePath? Certainly, useful for loading JS and CSS. But also useful for other file types that an app may need, such as images or JSON data.
