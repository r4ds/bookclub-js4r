# Overview

**Learning objectives:**

- Book-club admin
  - Introductions
  - Repository
  - Set-up for contributors

- Explain why JavaScript may be a useful tool for an R developer
- Introduce some
  - JavaScript libraries
  - R packages that use JavaScript
  - JavaScript training material / tutorials

## Rationale

- R & JS have quite different responsibilities

- Why use JavaScript as an R dev
  - JS might have solved your problem
  - JS can do things that R cannot
  - To improve communication of insights

- R packages that use JavaScript
  - [{rmapshaper}](https://github.com/ateucher/rmapshaper) integrates the
  [mapshaper](https://github.com/mbloch/mapshaper/) library
  - [{plotly}](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.R) uses
  [plotly](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js)
  - [{waiter}](https://github.com/JohnCoene/waiter) based on various JS libraries

## Methods

Many ways to integrate JS with R

- Run JS code from R
  - {V8}
  - [V8 on CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/V8/index.html)
  - Used by {rmapshaper}
  - V8 is a JavaScript engine (used in Chrome and Node.js)

- Send data from R to JS, for viewing in the browser
  - {htmlwidgets}
  - [htmlwidgets on CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/htmlwidgets/index.html)
  - Send data from R to JS for viewing in the browser
  - Used to wrap JS visualisation libraries
  - Used by {plotly}, {DT}, {highcharter}

- Pass data back & forth between R and the browser
  - {shiny}
  - e.g., {waiter}

## Methods Amiss

Things that aren't covered by the book

- Send data from R to a specific front-end JS framework
  - React
    - See [{reactR}](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/reactR/index.html)
    - ... and its use in[{reactable}](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/reactable/index.html)
  - Vue
    - See [{vueR}](https://vue-r.github.io/vueR/)

- Use existing R packages to send data to a JS data visualisation library
  - D3
    - See [{r2d3}](https://rstudio.github.io/r2d3/)
